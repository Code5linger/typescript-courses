This might be a choice that we could embrace, and it works out fine for moving plants within a single zone.</p>\n<p>Hoever, when moving plants across zones, we need to think carefully about <em>transaction boundaries</em>. Let’s imagine that <code>Zone</code> is powered by a fairly reliable service — it’s up 99.999% of the time (a little over 8 hours of downtime per year). If we model a move of a plant across beds as <em>two atomic operations</em>, timetimes one of them will succeed and the other will fail. We could end up with cloned plants, or plants that disappear entirely from both beds!</p>\n<p>This illustrates why it’s so important to choose <em>where we put</em> a transaction boundary. So far, there are absolutely no operations that involve more than one <code>Workspace</code>, so it may be that we already have the split in the right location!</p>","tableOfContents":"","fields":{"slug":"/course/domain-modeling-with-ts/09-aggregates/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aggregates","course":"domain-modeling-with-ts","date":"June 10, 2025","description":"Let's think about transactionality and how it may lead us to design our semantic actions and data models"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/course/domain-modeling-with-ts/09-aggregates/","title":"Aggregates","course":"domain-modeling-with-ts","date":"2025-06-10T09:00:00.000Z","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/course/domain-modeling-with-ts/08-semantic-actions/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Semantic Actions","date":"2025-06-10T09:00:00.000Z","course":"domain-modeling-with-ts","isExercise":null}},"next":null}},
