Over time they’ll sort of “pile up” and it’ll be difficult to keep track of which one(s) are used and where. We may notice performance issues on client devices due to number of requests (HTTP/2 multiplexing mitigates this), more QPS hitting the API, and an increased tendency for race condition problems.</p>\n<p><strong>If we go with (3) we’re going to end up with an extremely complicated API</strong>, that significantly diverges from the RESTful model (which would seem to indicate that <code>GET /doctors</code> should be the single path where we get a list of doctors)</p>\n<p><strong>If we go with (4) we’ll introduce some non-trivial complexity to the existing endpoint</strong>, and introduce the need for more test cases.
